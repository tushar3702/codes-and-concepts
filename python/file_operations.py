üìò File Operations in Python
----------------------------
This script demonstrates basic file handling operations in Python:
1. Opening a file
2. Reading/Writing/Appending data
3. Closing or removing a file

Supported Modes:
----------------
'r'  -> Read (default)
'w'  -> Write (creates/overwrites file)
'a'  -> Append
'r+' -> Read and Write
'w+' -> Write and Read (overwrites file)
'a+' -> Append and Read
"""

    Writes text to a file (overwrites if file already exists).

        f.write(text)
    print(f"‚úÖ Written successfully to '{filename}'.")

    """
    Appends text to an existing file or creates one if not found.

    Reads and prints the content of a file.
